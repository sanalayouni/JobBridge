# Job Scraper & Candidate Matcher

**Branch:** `add-more-than-one-api`

This branch adds support for **multiple job APIs** to the Job Scraper project, while keeping the **candidate matcher** intact.

Currently, the project supports:

1. **Adzuna API** – France jobs
2. **Remotive API** – Remote jobs

The goal is to fetch job listings from multiple sources, combine them, and rank them according to candidate skills using **sentence embeddings**.

## Features in This Branch

* Added **Remotive API** integration
* Aggregates jobs from **Adzuna + Remotive**
* Preserves **original candidate matcher**
* Saves combined jobs to `data/jobs.json`
* Ensures jobs are **compatible with matcher** (fields: `title`, `description`, `location`, `skills`, `url`)

---

## Requirements

Python 3.9+ recommended

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example `requirements.txt`:**

```
requests
sentence-transformers
scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure you are on this branch:

```bash
git checkout add-more-than-one-api
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Output:

* `data/jobs.json` → combined job listings
* Console → top 10 ranked jobs for the candidate

---

## Candidate Matcher

The matcher uses **Sentence-BERT embeddings** and **cosine similarity**:

* Candidate profile (`candidate.json`) contains:

  * `job_title`
  * `skills` (list)
  * `location`
* Each job listing is represented as:

  * `title`, `description`, `location`, `skills`, `url`, `source`
* The matcher calculates **match_score** (0–100%) and ranks jobs

---

## How to Add More APIs

1. Create a new Python file in `apis/` with a `fetch_jobs()` function
2. Return a list of job dictionaries compatible with matcher
3. Update `aggregator.py` to include the new API:

```python
from apis.new_api import fetch_jobs as fetch_new_api
jobs.extend(fetch_new_api())
```

---

## Notes

* Branch name: `add-more-than-one-api`
* Keep `matcher.py` **unchanged**
* Optional: implement deduplication for jobs with same `title + location`
